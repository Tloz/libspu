*     /\      libspu - for SimpleProjectUtilities - gathers a bunch of
*    /__\     useful tools that you may use several times and don't want to
*   /\  /\    rewrite everytime you start a new project. Most likely you've 
*  /__\/__\   already done something like that yourself (and if not I encou-
*             age you to do so). So you're free to use this lib in any of
*  your work. No credit required. You don't need to tell me, pay me a coffee
*  or whatever. I want you to save time, not spend it on saying thank you.
*  Time is all we truly have, and it runs out so fast. You're also free not
*  to use this program. I don't need anyone to use it. I'm not planning to 
*  make money out of it, and neither should you, but, hey, if you want, 
*  I don't mind. Treat it like a gift from a distant relative: if you never
*  use it, it you send it to the junkyard, really, once more, I swear 
*  that I DON'T MIND. Therefore, this project is licensed under the terms 
*  of the Unlicence.
*
*             However, if you found some bugs, please report them by opening
*  an issue on the repository mentionned above. That would make you a great 
*  human beeing, and Marguerite the cow would be so happy if you do! 
*  Feature requests are welcome too! Just keep in mind I'm alone on this.
* 
*                       Thus being said, have fun coding !
